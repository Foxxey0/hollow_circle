# hollow_circle
personal project. rendering a hollow circle.

simple project i wanted to do in order to see how efficient i could do graphics. Spent much time on looking for ways to make it faster. Ultimately, I accepted that its realistically possible for me to be able to render my hollow circle in the theoretically most efficient way. Windows complicates things. The best thing to do would be to use opengl, but i avoided doing that because the point was to do everything on my own. I wanted to handle EVERYTHING.
